# project3_mc_gyver

That's Openclassrooms third project.

You are MacGyver and you have to escape the maze !
To reach your goal you have to collect 3 items: Ether, Needle, Tube. It will allow you to defeat Murdoc, the maze's boss.
Without this items, he will kill you, that's all..

To run the game you have to install python3 and pygame (info about versions in requirements.txt).
To launch the game use: python3 main.py

This project is my first one, the goal is to practice on a tangible case, what we have learn during this first month.
It is about python classes, functions, algorithms, git.
